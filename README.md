This is my first snake game. Nothing so special. 

To turn on display of snake's segments' coordinates, uncomment update_body_window() method in snake.py and the same string in main.py file. Maybe it'll be helphul.

I guess that you can play game like that, but if you dont:
--to turn down, press down button
--to turn up, press up button 
--to turn left, press left button
--to turn right, press right button.

Thanks for meeting this repository ^_^
